## db 0.4.0 (09/12/2020)

Don't call it a rewrite (*Breaking Changes*)

This commit was almost completely backwards compatible.

One function changed signature because it was super confusing,

update-all changed from

(update-all :post {:id [1 2 3]} {:name "new name"})

to

(update-all :post :set {:name "new name"} :where {:id [1 2 3]})

A bunch of other things changed too, a lot of functions are now
private that should have been before, so that's technically a
breaking change.

The biggest feature that comes out of all this is multi table join,
join/one and join/many!

One less reason to drop down to sql!
